<h1> DefiSafetyâ€™s Process Quality Review version 0.8 </h1>

We have added some exciting new components to our reviews. These included metrics concerning Oracles and Timelocks. In addition, we have completely re-written our background documentation, as well as rephrased the entirety of our review template in order to make it increasingly understandable for our users. Lastly, we have re-weighted much of our scoring allocations by putting a larger emphasis on Access Controls, now re-named Admin Controls.
