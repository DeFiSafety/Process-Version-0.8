# Process-Version-08
Hello, and thank for agreeing to review DefiSafetyâ€™s 0.8 version of our process! 

We have added some exciting new components to our reviews, including Oracles, and Timelocks. We have completely re-written our background documentation, as well as rephrased the entirety of our blank review to create something easier for a user to understand. We have also re-weighted much of our scoring. 


<p>We would appreciate that you go through the documentation, and answer some questions we have about the way the data is. This will only take about 10 minutes of your time. </p>
Please visit the [0.8 Blank draft](https://github.com/DeFiSafety/Process-Version-0.8/blob/main/0.8%20blank.pdf/) . Please give us some initial thoughts on this report, and please pay particular attention to questions 24 to 28, as these are the new questions we have added.

<p>
Please take a brief look at our new Scoring Algorithm. This breaks down the specific scores on a question-to question basis. Please pay specific attention to the breakdown of individual scoring categories, such as the weight of the Oracles category.
