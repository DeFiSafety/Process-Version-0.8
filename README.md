# Process-Version-08
Hello, and thank you for agreeing to review DefiSafetyâ€™s 0.8 version of our process! 

We have added some exciting new components to our reviews. These included metrics concerning Oracles and Timelocks. In addition, we have completely re-written our background documentation, as well as rephrased the entirety of our review template in order to make it increasingly understandable for our users. Lastly, we have re-weighted much of our scoring allocations by putting a larger emphasis on Access Controls. 


<p>We would appreciate that you go through the documentation, and provide your input on the contents and presentation of our data. This will only take about 10 minutes of your time. </p>


You can visit the [0.8 Blank draft](https://github.com/DeFiSafety/Process-Version-0.8/blob/main/0.8%20blank.pdf/) to gain some initial thoughts on this report. Please pay particular attention to questions 24 to 28, as these are the new questions we have added to our reviewing process concerning Oracles and Timelocks.
  

Following the 0.8 Blank draft, you can take a look at our new [Scoring Algorithm](https://github.com/DeFiSafety/Process-Version-0.8/blob/main/Copy%20of%20Proposed%20scoring%20changes.xlsx). It breaks down the specific scores on a question-to-question basis. Please pay attention to the breakdown of individual scoring categories, such as the guidances or weights of the Oracles and Timelocks category.
